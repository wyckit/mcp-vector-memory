# MCP Engram Memory

A cognitive memory MCP server that provides an LLM with namespace-isolated vector storage, k-nearest-neighbor search (cosine similarity), a knowledge graph, semantic clustering, lifecycle management with activation energy decay, and physics-based re-ranking. Data is persisted to disk as JSON with debounced writes.

## Quickstart

**Option 1 — dotnet (recommended)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wyckit/mcp-engram-memory.git
cd mcp-engram-memory
dotnet build
```

Add to your MCP client config (Claude Code, Copilot, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "engram-memory": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "/path/to/mcp-engram-memory/src/McpEngramMemory"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2 — Docker**

```bash
docker build -t mcp-engram-memory .
docker run -i -v memory-data:/app/data mcp-engram-memory
```

**Option 3 — NuGet (embed in your app)**

```bash
dotnet add package McpEngramMemory.Core --version 0.5.0
```

That's it. The server exposes 43 MCP tools. To reduce tool count, set `MEMORY_TOOL_PROFILE`:

| Profile | Tools | Use case |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `minimal` | 8 | Core CRUD + admin + composite tools — drop-in memory for any agent |
| `standard` | 27 | Adds graph, lifecycle, clustering, intelligence |
| `full` | 43 | Everything including expert routing, debate, benchmarks (default) |

```json
{
  "env": { "MEMORY_TOOL_PROFILE": "minimal" }
}
```

See [`examples/`](examples/) for ready-to-use config files.

### The Core Memory Loop

```
INGEST → INDEX → RETRIEVE → REINFORCE → DECAY → SUMMARIZE/COLLAPSE
   │                  │          │          │              │
   └── store_memory   │   memory_feedback  │    collapse_cluster
       (embed+upsert) │   (agent feedback) │    (DBSCAN → summary)
                      └── search_memory    └── decay_cycle
                          (k-NN/hybrid)    (activation energy)
```

Memories move through lifecycle states based on usage:

```
STM (short-term) ──promote──→ LTM (long-term) ──decay──→ Archived
                   ←─────────────────────────────────── deep_recall
                              (auto-resurrect if score ≥ 0.7)
```

## Project Structure

The solution is split into two projects:

| Project | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `McpEngramMemory` | Executable | MCP server with stdio transport — register this in your MCP client |
| `McpEngramMemory.Core` | NuGet Library | Core engine (vector index, graph, clustering, lifecycle, persistence) — use this to embed the memory engine in your own application |

## MCP Tools (43 total)

### Core Memory (3 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `store_memory` | Store a vector embedding with text, category, and optional metadata. Defaults to STM lifecycle state. Warns if near-duplicates are detected. |
| `search_memory` | k-NN search within a namespace with optional lifecycle/category filtering, summary-first mode, physics-based re-ranking, and `explain` mode for full retrieval diagnostics. |
| `delete_memory` | Remove a memory entry by ID. Cascades to remove associated graph edges and cluster memberships. |

### Composite Tools (3 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `remember` | Intelligent store: saves a memory with auto-generated embedding, duplicate detection, and auto-linking to related existing memories. Use instead of store_memory + detect_duplicates + link_memories. |
| `recall` | Intelligent search: searches with auto-routing to the best namespace via expert dispatch, with fallback to direct search. Combines search_memory + dispatch_task in one call. |
| `reflect` | Store a lesson or retrospective with auto-linking to related memories. Wraps store_memory + link_memories for end-of-session knowledge capture. |

### Knowledge Graph (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `link_memories` | Create a directed edge between two entries with a relation type and weight. `cross_reference` auto-creates bidirectional edges. |
| `unlink_memories` | Remove edges between entries, optionally filtered by relation type. |
| `get_neighbors` | Get directly connected entries with edges. Supports direction filtering (outgoing/incoming/both). |
| `traverse_graph` | Multi-hop BFS traversal with configurable depth (max 5), relation filter, minimum weight, and max results. |

Supported relation types: `parent_child`, `cross_reference`, `similar_to`, `contradicts`, `elaborates`, `depends_on`, `custom`.

### Semantic Clustering (5 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_cluster` | Create a named cluster from member entry IDs. Centroid is computed automatically. |
| `update_cluster` | Add/remove members and update the label. Centroid is recomputed. |
| `store_cluster_summary` | Store an LLM-generated summary as a searchable entry linked to the cluster. |
| `get_cluster` | Retrieve full cluster details including members and summary info. |
| `list_clusters` | List all clusters in a namespace with summary status. |

### Lifecycle Management (5 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `promote_memory` | Manually transition a memory between lifecycle states (`stm`, `ltm`, `archived`). |
| `memory_feedback` | Provide agent feedback on a memory's usefulness. Positive feedback boosts activation energy and records an access; negative feedback suppresses it. Triggers state transitions when thresholds are crossed. Closes the agent reinforcement loop. |
| `deep_recall` | Search across ALL lifecycle states. Auto-resurrects high-scoring archived entries above the resurrection threshold. |
| `decay_cycle` | Trigger activation energy recomputation and state transitions for a namespace. |
| `configure_decay` | Set per-namespace decay parameters (decayRate, reinforcementWeight, stmThreshold, archiveThreshold). Used by background service and `decay_cycle` with `useStoredConfig=true`. |

Activation energy formula: `(accessCount x reinforcementWeight) - (hoursSinceLastAccess x decayRate)`

### Admin (3 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_memory` | Retrieve full cognitive context for an entry (lifecycle, edges, clusters). Does not count as an access. |
| `cognitive_stats` | System overview: entry counts by state, cluster count, edge count, and namespace list. |
| `purge_debates` | Delete stale `active-debate-*` namespaces older than a configurable age (default: 24 hours). Supports dry-run mode. |

### Accretion (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_pending_collapses` | List dense LTM clusters detected by the background scanner that are awaiting LLM summarization. |
| `collapse_cluster` | Execute a pending collapse: store a summary entry, archive the source members, and create a cluster. |
| `dismiss_collapse` | Dismiss a detected collapse and exclude its members from future scans. |
| `trigger_accretion_scan` | Manually run a DBSCAN density scan on LTM entries in a namespace. |

`collapse_cluster` reliability behavior:
- If collapse steps complete successfully, the pending collapse is removed and a reversal record is persisted to disk.
- If summary storage or any member archival step fails, the tool returns an error and preserves the pending collapse so the same `collapseId` can be retried.
- Collapse records survive server restarts and can be reversed with `uncollapse_cluster`.

### Intelligence & Safety (5 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `detect_duplicates` | Find near-duplicate entries in a namespace by pairwise cosine similarity above a configurable threshold. |
| `find_contradictions` | Surface contradictions: entries linked with `contradicts` graph edges, plus high-similarity topic-relevant pairs for review. |
| `merge_memories` | Merge two duplicate entries: keeps the first entry's vector, combines metadata and access counts, transfers graph edges and cluster memberships, and archives the second entry. |
| `uncollapse_cluster` | Reverse a previously executed accretion collapse: restore archived members to pre-collapse state, delete summary, clean up cluster. |
| `list_collapse_history` | List all reversible collapse records for a namespace. |

### Panel of Experts / Debate (3 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `consult_expert_panel` | Consult a panel of experts by running parallel searches across multiple expert namespaces. Stores each perspective in an active-debate namespace and returns integer-aliased results so the LLM can reference nodes without managing UUIDs. Replaces multiple `search_memory` + `store_memory` calls with a single macro-command. |
| `map_debate_graph` | Map logical relationships between debate nodes using integer aliases from `consult_expert_panel`. Translates aliases to UUIDs internally and batch-creates knowledge graph edges. Replaces multiple `link_memories` calls with a single macro-command. |
| `resolve_debate` | Resolve a debate by storing a consensus summary as LTM, linking it to the winning perspective, and batch-archiving all raw debate nodes. Cleans up session state. Replaces manual `store_memory` + `link_memories` + `promote_memory` calls with a single macro-command. |

Debate workflow: `consult_expert_panel` (gather perspectives) → `map_debate_graph` (define relationships) → `resolve_debate` (store consensus). Sessions use integer aliases (1, 2, 3...) so the LLM never handles UUIDs. Sessions auto-expire after 1 hour.

### Benchmarking & Observability (3 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `run_benchmark` | Run an IR quality benchmark. Datasets: `default-v1` (25 seeds, 20 queries), `paraphrase-v1` (25 seeds, 15 queries), `multihop-v1` (25 seeds, 15 queries), `scale-v1` (80 seeds, 30 queries), `realworld-v1` (30 seeds, 20 queries — cognitive memory patterns). Computes Recall@K, Precision@K, MRR, nDCG@K, and latency percentiles. |
| `get_metrics` | Get operational metrics: latency percentiles (P50/P95/P99), throughput, and counts for search, store, and other operations. |
| `reset_metrics` | Reset collected operational metrics. Optionally filter by operation type. |

Five benchmark datasets: four covering generic CS topics (programming languages, data structures, ML, databases, networking, systems, security, DevOps) and one real-world dataset modeled after actual cognitive memory entries (architecture decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, user preferences, lessons learned). Relevance grades use a 0–3 scale (3 = highly relevant).

### Maintenance (2 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `rebuild_embeddings` | Re-embed all entries in one or all namespaces using the current embedding model. Use after upgrading the embedding model to regenerate vectors from stored text. Entries without text are skipped. Preserves all metadata, lifecycle state, and timestamps. |
| `compression_stats` | Show vector compression statistics for a namespace or all namespaces. Reports FP32 vs Int8 disk savings, quantization coverage, and memory footprint estimates. |

### Expert Routing (3 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `dispatch_task` | Route a query to the most relevant expert namespace via semantic similarity. Supports flat comparison or hierarchical tree routing (`hierarchical=true`) through root → branch → leaf domain nodes. Returns expert profile and context, or `needs_expert` if no match. |
| `create_expert` | Instantiate a new expert namespace and register it in the semantic routing meta-index. Supports `level` parameter (`root`, `branch`, `leaf`) and `parentNodeId` for hierarchical domain tree construction. |
| `get_domain_tree` | Show the full hierarchical expert domain tree with root domains, branches, and leaf experts. Useful for understanding the routing topology. |

Expert routing workflow: `dispatch_task` (route query) → if miss: `create_expert` (define specialist) → `dispatch_task` (retry). The system maintains a hidden `_system_experts` meta-index that maps queries to specialized namespaces via cosine similarity (default threshold: 0.75). Experts within a 5% score margin of the top match are returned as candidates.

**Hierarchical routing (HMoE)**: Use `create_expert` with `level="root"` or `level="branch"` to build a domain tree. Set `hierarchical=true` on `dispatch_task` to enable coarse-to-fine tree walk: score roots → narrow to branches → select leaf experts. Falls back to flat routing if no tree exists. All routing uses local ONNX embeddings + SIMD dot products — zero LLM API calls.

## Architecture

### Services

`CognitiveIndex` is a thin facade managing CRUD, locking, and memory limits. Search, hybrid search, and duplicate detection are delegated to stateless engines that operate on data snapshots.

| `DecayBackgroundService` | 15 minutes | Runs activation energy decay on all namespaces using stored per-namespace configs |
| `AccretionBackgroundService` | 30 minutes | Scans all namespaces for dense LTM clusters needing summarization |

### Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `CognitiveEntry` | Core memory entry with vector, text, metadata, lifecycle state, and activation energy |
| `QuantizedVector` | Int8 quantized vector with `sbyte[]` data, min/scale for reconstruction, and precomputed self-dot product |
| `FloatArrayBase64Converter` | JSON converter for `float[]` — writes Base64 strings, reads both Base64 and legacy JSON arrays for backwards compatibility |

### Searchable Compression

Vectors use a lifecycle-driven compression pipeline:

- **STM entries**: Full FP32 precision for maximum search accuracy
- **LTM/archived entries**: Auto-quantized to Int8 (asymmetric min/max → [-128, 127]) on state transition
- **HNSW index**: Namespaces with 200+ entries auto-build an HNSW graph for O(log N) approximate nearest neighbor candidate generation
- **Two-stage search**: Namespaces with 30–199 entries use Int8 screening (top k×5 candidates) followed by FP32 exact cosine reranking
- **SIMD acceleration**: `Int8DotProduct` uses `System.Numerics.Vector<T>` for portable hardware-accelerated dot products (sbyte→short→int widening pipeline)
- **Base64 persistence**: Vectors are serialized as Base64 strings instead of JSON number arrays, reducing disk usage by ~60%. Legacy JSON arrays are still readable for backwards compatibility.

### Persistence

Two storage backends are available, selectable via environment variable:

**JSON file backend** (default):
- Data stored in a `data/` directory as JSON files
- `{namespace}.json` — entries with Base64-encoded vectors (per namespace)
- `_edges.json` — graph edges (global)
- `_clusters.json` — semantic clusters (global)
- `_collapse_history.json` — reversible collapse records (global)
- `_decay_configs.json` — per-namespace decay configurations (global)
- Writes are debounced (500ms default) with SHA-256 checksums for crash recovery

**SQLite backend** (`MEMORY_STORAGE=sqlite`):
- Single `memory.db` file with WAL mode for concurrent read/write
- Tables: `entries`, `edges`, `clusters`, `collapse_history`, `decay_configs`, `schema_version`
- Automatic schema migrations (v1→v2 adds `lifecycle_state` column with backfill)
- Suitable for higher-throughput or multi-process scenarios

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MEMORY_TOOL_PROFILE` | `full` | Tool profile: `minimal` (8 tools), `standard` (27 tools), `full` (43 tools) |
| `MEMORY_STORAGE` | `json` | Storage backend: `json` or `sqlite` |
| `MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH` | `data/memory.db` | SQLite database file path (only when `MEMORY_STORAGE=sqlite`) |
| `MEMORY_MAX_NAMESPACE_SIZE` | unlimited | Maximum entries per namespace |
| `MEMORY_MAX_TOTAL_COUNT` | unlimited | Maximum total entries across all namespaces |

## Usage

### MCP Server

Configure the MCP server in your client (e.g. Claude Desktop, VS Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "engram-memory": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "/path/to/mcp-engram-memory/src/McpEngramMemory"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_STORAGE": "sqlite",
        "MEMORY_MAX_NAMESPACE_SIZE": "10000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `env` block is optional. Omit it to use the JSON file backend with no memory limits.

## AI Assistant Setup

Each setup below is a single prompt you paste into the respective tool. The AI will read this README, create all config files, and write the custom instructions for you.

### Claude Code Setup

Open Claude Code in your project directory and paste:

```
Set up mcp-engram-memory as my persistent memory system. Do the following:

1. Add the MCP server to my Claude Code config. The server runs via:
   command: dotnet
   args: run --project /path/to/mcp-engram-memory/src/McpEngramMemory

2. Create or update my CLAUDE.md (global at ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md) with these sections:

   ## Recall: Search Before You Work
   - At conversation start, search vector memory using up to 3 parallel agents:
     Agent 1: search_memory in the project namespace for the current task
       (use hybrid: true and expandGraph: true for richer recall)
     Agent 2: search_memory in "work" and "synthesis" namespaces for cross-project patterns
     Agent 3: search_memory with alternative phrasings/keywords in the project namespace
       (use hybrid: true for keyword+vector fusion)
   - For graph-connected knowledge, use expandGraph: true to pull in linked memories
   - Tool selection: search_memory for project context, dispatch_task for cross-domain
     questions, consult_expert_panel for multi-perspective analysis, deep_recall for
     archived knowledge, detect_duplicates and find_contradictions for quality checks

   ## Store: Save What You Learn
   - Store memories after completing tasks, fixing bugs, learning patterns, or receiving
     corrections. Use the project directory name as namespace, kebab-case IDs, include
     domain keywords in text for searchability, and categorize as one of: decision, pattern,
     bug-fix, architecture, preference, lesson, reference
   - Pre-store quality checks: verify text is self-contained, includes domain keywords,
     doesn't duplicate existing memories, and has the correct category
   - When store_memory warns about duplicates: skip if existing is accurate, upsert same
     ID if outdated, or store and link if both are distinct

   ## Expert Routing
   - Use dispatch_task for open-ended questions. If it returns needs_expert,
     call create_expert with a detailed persona, then seed that expert's namespace
   - Lifecycle: promote STM to LTM when recalled 2+ times, documents a stable pattern,
     captures a recurring bug fix, or records a user correction
   - Link related memories with link_memories using: parent_child, cross_reference,
     similar_to, contradicts, elaborates, depends_on

   ## Session Retrospective
   - At the end of significant sessions, self-evaluate: what went well, what went wrong,
     what you'd do differently, key decisions made
   - Store retrospective with: id "retro-YYYY-MM-DD-topic", category "lesson",
     specific actionable lessons (not vague observations)
   - Link retrospectives to related bug fixes, patterns, or decisions
   - Search past retrospectives before starting similar work

### GitHub Copilot Setup

Open VS Code with Copilot and paste in chat:

```
Set up mcp-engram-memory as my persistent memory system. Do the following:

1. Create .vscode/mcp.json with a stdio server entry:
   name: engram-memory
   command: dotnet
   args: ["run", "--project", "/path/to/mcp-engram-memory/src/McpEngramMemory"]

2. Create .github/copilot-instructions.md with vector memory instructions:

   ## Recall
   - Before starting any task, use search_memory with the project namespace to recall
     relevant context. Use hybrid: true for keyword+vector fusion and expandGraph: true
     to pull in linked memories. Search for past decisions and bugs before answering.
   - Tool selection: search_memory for project context, dispatch_task for cross-domain
     questions (auto-routes to best expert namespace), consult_expert_panel for multiple
     perspectives, deep_recall for archived/forgotten knowledge, detect_duplicates and
     find_contradictions for memory quality.

   ## Store
   - Store memories after completing tasks, fixing bugs, learning patterns, or receiving
     corrections. Use project directory name as namespace, kebab-case IDs, write text
     with domain keywords for future searchability, categorize as: decision, pattern,
     bug-fix, architecture, preference, lesson, reference.
   - Pre-store quality checks: verify text is self-contained, includes domain keywords,
     doesn't duplicate existing memories, and has the correct category.
   - On duplicate warnings: skip if existing is accurate, upsert if outdated, store and
     link if both are distinct.

   ## Expert Routing
   - dispatch_task routes to experts automatically. If needs_expert is returned, use
     create_expert with a detailed persona description, then populate the expert namespace.
   - Lifecycle: promote STM to LTM when stable and reused across sessions.
   - Link related memories using: parent_child, cross_reference, similar_to, contradicts,
     elaborates, depends_on.

   ## Session Retrospective
   - At the end of significant sessions, store a self-evaluation: what went well, what
     went wrong, lessons learned. Use id "retro-YYYY-MM-DD-topic", category "lesson".
   - Search past retrospectives before starting similar work to avoid repeating mistakes.

## Sample Prompts

Once the memory system is configured with your AI assistant, these sample prompts demonstrate how to leverage the full tool suite effectively. Copy and adapt them to your workflow.

### Quick Reference Prompts

**Search before you work** — recall context at the start of any task:
```
Search engram memory for anything related to [topic] in the [project] namespace.
Use hybrid search with graph expansion to pull in connected knowledge.
```

**Store what you learn** — after completing a task or fixing a bug:
```
Store a memory about [what you did and why] in the [project] namespace.
Category: [decision|pattern|bug-fix|architecture|lesson]. Link it to related memories.
```

**Check system health** — quick status overview:
```
Run cognitive_stats, get_metrics, and compression_stats to show me the current
state of our engram memory system.
```

**Run benchmarks** — verify IR quality hasn't regressed:
```
Run all 5 benchmark datasets (default-v1, paraphrase-v1, multihop-v1, scale-v1,
realworld-v1) and compare results against our stored baselines in benchmarks/.
```

### Power Prompts

These are real-world prompts that exercise many tools in a single session — expert panels, parallel agents, memory management, and engineering execution.

**Strategic planning with expert panel:**
```
Utilizing our engram memory and knowledge of the current state of our project,
using our panel of experts, what do you think we should focus on next?
```

This prompt triggers: `search_memory` (project context recall), `consult_expert_panel` (multi-namespace parallel search), `dispatch_task` (expert routing), and synthesizes cross-domain perspectives into prioritized recommendations.

**Full autonomous engineering session:**
```
I like the order you suggested. Go through P1, P2, P3, P4. Research to see if
we need to upsert any experts with relevant subject area information. If our
memories are getting too big and we need to prune them / reorganize to shrink
and spread things out, please take some agents and do that. But for our main
engineering, feel free to use up to 20 agent experts to accomplish these
priority tasks. If you run into questions while you plan and implement, please
use the engram panel of experts to resolve any questions you might have. Make
sure everything builds correctly at the end and tests validate our functions
as well as pass.
```

This prompt triggers the full tool suite:
- **Expert management**: `dispatch_task`, `create_expert`, `search_memory` across expert namespaces
- **Memory maintenance**: `detect_duplicates`, `merge_memories`, `trigger_accretion_scan`, `collapse_cluster`
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple agents working on priority tasks concurrently
- **Quality gates**: `consult_expert_panel` for architectural decisions, `find_contradictions` to resolve conflicts
- **Validation**: Build and test verification at the end of the session

### Prompt Patterns

| Pattern | What it does | Key tools exercised |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| "Search memory for X" | Direct recall | `search_memory` |
| "What do experts think about X" | Multi-perspective analysis | `consult_expert_panel`, `map_debate_graph`, `resolve_debate` |
| "Route this question to the right expert" | Semantic routing | `dispatch_task`, `create_expert` |
| "Clean up / prune memories in X namespace" | Memory maintenance | `detect_duplicates`, `merge_memories`, `trigger_accretion_scan` |
| "Store what we just learned" | Knowledge capture | `store_memory`, `link_memories`, `promote_memory` |
| "Run benchmarks and compare to baseline" | Quality validation | `run_benchmark`, `get_metrics`, `compression_stats` |
| "Deep search including archived" | Full recall | `deep_recall` (auto-resurrects high-scoring archived entries) |

## Benchmarks

Benchmark results are stored in `benchmarks/` organized by date. Each run captures IR quality metrics (Recall@K, Precision@K, MRR, nDCG@K) and latency percentiles across 5 datasets and 4 search modes.

```

    realworld-v1-hybrid.json
    ...
  2026-03-20/                         # Day 10 stability test (12 configs + ops)
    default-v1-vector.json
    scale-v1-hybrid_rerank.json
    realworld-v1-hybrid.json
    operational-metrics.json          # System state + live latency snapshot
    ...
```

### Key Findings (as of 2026-03-20)

| Dataset | Best Mode | Recall@K | MRR | Notes |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----|-------|
| default-v1 (25 seeds) | vector_rerank | 0.900 | 1.000 | Reranker adds +0.033 recall |
| paraphrase-v1 (25 seeds) | vector | 0.944 | 1.000 | Strong paraphrase resilience |
| multihop-v1 (25 seeds) | vector | 0.939 | 1.000 | Highest precision (0.587) |
| scale-v1 (80 seeds) | vector_rerank | 0.716 | 0.978 | Hybrid hurts at scale |
| realworld-v1 (30 seeds) | hybrid | 0.788 | 0.935 | BM25 critical for technical jargon |

**Mode selection guide**: Default to `vector` for speed. Use `vector_rerank` for quality-critical queries. Use `hybrid` only for domain-specific technical data where keyword overlap matters. Avoid `hybrid_rerank` at scale.
