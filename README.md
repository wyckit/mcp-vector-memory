# MCP Vector Memory

A cognitive memory MCP server that provides an LLM with namespace-isolated vector storage, k-nearest-neighbor search (cosine similarity), a knowledge graph, semantic clustering, lifecycle management with activation energy decay, and physics-based re-ranking. Data is persisted to disk as JSON with debounced writes.

## Project Structure

The solution is split into two projects:

| Project | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `McpVectorMemory` | Executable | MCP server with stdio transport — register this in your MCP client |
| `McpVectorMemory.Core` | NuGet Library | Core engine (vector index, graph, clustering, lifecycle, persistence) — use this to embed the memory engine in your own application |

```

```

## NuGet Package

The core engine is available as a NuGet package for use in your own .NET applications.

```bash
dotnet add package McpVectorMemory.Core --version 0.2.0
```

### Library Usage

```csharp
using McpVectorMemory.Core.Models;
using McpVectorMemory.Core.Services;

// Create services
var persistence = new PersistenceManager();
var embedding = new OnnxEmbeddingService();
var index = new CognitiveIndex(persistence);
var graph = new KnowledgeGraph(persistence, index);
var clusters = new ClusterManager(index, persistence);
var lifecycle = new LifecycleEngine(index, persistence);

// Store a memory
var vector = embedding.Embed("The capital of France is Paris");
var entry = new CognitiveEntry("fact-1", vector, "default", "The capital of France is Paris", "facts");
index.Upsert(entry);

// Search by text
var queryVector = embedding.Embed("French capital");
var results = index.Search(queryVector, "default", k: 5);
```

## MCP Tools (33 total)

### Core Memory (3 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `store_memory` | Store a vector embedding with text, category, and optional metadata. Defaults to STM lifecycle state. Warns if near-duplicates are detected. |
| `search_memory` | k-NN search within a namespace with optional lifecycle/category filtering, summary-first mode, physics-based re-ranking, and `explain` mode for full retrieval diagnostics. |
| `delete_memory` | Remove a memory entry by ID. Cascades to remove associated graph edges and cluster memberships. |

### Knowledge Graph (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `link_memories` | Create a directed edge between two entries with a relation type and weight. `cross_reference` auto-creates bidirectional edges. |
| `unlink_memories` | Remove edges between entries, optionally filtered by relation type. |
| `get_neighbors` | Get directly connected entries with edges. Supports direction filtering (outgoing/incoming/both). |
| `traverse_graph` | Multi-hop BFS traversal with configurable depth (max 5), relation filter, minimum weight, and max results. |

Supported relation types: `parent_child`, `cross_reference`, `similar_to`, `contradicts`, `elaborates`, `depends_on`, `custom`.

### Semantic Clustering (5 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_cluster` | Create a named cluster from member entry IDs. Centroid is computed automatically. |
| `update_cluster` | Add/remove members and update the label. Centroid is recomputed. |
| `store_cluster_summary` | Store an LLM-generated summary as a searchable entry linked to the cluster. |
| `get_cluster` | Retrieve full cluster details including members and summary info. |
| `list_clusters` | List all clusters in a namespace with summary status. |

### Lifecycle Management (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `promote_memory` | Manually transition a memory between lifecycle states (`stm`, `ltm`, `archived`). |
| `deep_recall` | Search across ALL lifecycle states. Auto-resurrects high-scoring archived entries above the resurrection threshold. |
| `decay_cycle` | Trigger activation energy recomputation and state transitions for a namespace. |
| `configure_decay` | Set per-namespace decay parameters (decayRate, reinforcementWeight, stmThreshold, archiveThreshold). Used by background service and `decay_cycle` with `useStoredConfig=true`. |

Activation energy formula: `(accessCount x reinforcementWeight) - (hoursSinceLastAccess x decayRate)`

### Admin (2 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_memory` | Retrieve full cognitive context for an entry (lifecycle, edges, clusters). Does not count as an access. |
| `cognitive_stats` | System overview: entry counts by state, cluster count, edge count, and namespace list. |

### Accretion (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_pending_collapses` | List dense LTM clusters detected by the background scanner that are awaiting LLM summarization. |
| `collapse_cluster` | Execute a pending collapse: store a summary entry, archive the source members, and create a cluster. |
| `dismiss_collapse` | Dismiss a detected collapse and exclude its members from future scans. |
| `trigger_accretion_scan` | Manually run a DBSCAN density scan on LTM entries in a namespace. |

`collapse_cluster` reliability behavior:
- If collapse steps complete successfully, the pending collapse is removed and a reversal record is persisted to disk.
- If summary storage or any member archival step fails, the tool returns an error and preserves the pending collapse so the same `collapseId` can be retried.
- Collapse records survive server restarts and can be reversed with `uncollapse_cluster`.

### Intelligence & Safety (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `detect_duplicates` | Find near-duplicate entries in a namespace by pairwise cosine similarity above a configurable threshold. |
| `find_contradictions` | Surface contradictions: entries linked with `contradicts` graph edges, plus high-similarity topic-relevant pairs for review. |
| `uncollapse_cluster` | Reverse a previously executed accretion collapse: restore archived members to pre-collapse state, delete summary, clean up cluster. |
| `list_collapse_history` | List all reversible collapse records for a namespace. |

### Panel of Experts / Debate (3 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `consult_expert_panel` | Consult a panel of experts by running parallel searches across multiple expert namespaces. Stores each perspective in an active-debate namespace and returns integer-aliased results so the LLM can reference nodes without managing UUIDs. Replaces multiple `search_memory` + `store_memory` calls with a single macro-command. |
| `map_debate_graph` | Map logical relationships between debate nodes using integer aliases from `consult_expert_panel`. Translates aliases to UUIDs internally and batch-creates knowledge graph edges. Replaces multiple `link_memories` calls with a single macro-command. |
| `resolve_debate` | Resolve a debate by storing a consensus summary as LTM, linking it to the winning perspective, and batch-archiving all raw debate nodes. Cleans up session state. Replaces manual `store_memory` + `link_memories` + `promote_memory` calls with a single macro-command. |

Debate workflow: `consult_expert_panel` (gather perspectives) → `map_debate_graph` (define relationships) → `resolve_debate` (store consensus). Sessions use integer aliases (1, 2, 3...) so the LLM never handles UUIDs. Sessions auto-expire after 1 hour.

### Benchmarking & Observability (3 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `run_benchmark` | Run an IR quality benchmark. Datasets: `default-v1` (25 seeds, 20 queries), `paraphrase-v1` (25 seeds, 15 queries), `multihop-v1` (25 seeds, 15 queries), `scale-v1` (80 seeds, 30 queries). Computes Recall@K, Precision@K, MRR, nDCG@K, and latency percentiles. |
| `get_metrics` | Get operational metrics: latency percentiles (P50/P95/P99), throughput, and counts for search, store, and other operations. |
| `reset_metrics` | Reset collected operational metrics. Optionally filter by operation type. |

Four benchmark datasets covering programming languages, data structures, ML, databases, networking, systems, security, and DevOps topics. Relevance grades use a 0–3 scale (3 = highly relevant).

### Maintenance (1 tool)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `rebuild_embeddings` | Re-embed all entries in one or all namespaces using the current embedding model. Use after upgrading the embedding model to regenerate vectors from stored text. Entries without text are skipped. Preserves all metadata, lifecycle state, and timestamps. |

### Persistence

Data is stored as JSON files in a `data/` directory:
- `{namespace}.json` — entries (per namespace)
- `_edges.json` — graph edges (global)
- `_clusters.json` — semantic clusters (global)
- `_collapse_history.json` — reversible collapse records (global)
- `_decay_configs.json` — per-namespace decay configurations (global)

Writes are debounced (500ms default) to avoid excessive disk I/O.
