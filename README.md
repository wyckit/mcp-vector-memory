# MCP Vector Memory

A cognitive memory MCP server that provides an LLM with namespace-isolated vector storage, k-nearest-neighbor search (cosine similarity), a knowledge graph, semantic clustering, lifecycle management with activation energy decay, and physics-based re-ranking. Data is persisted to disk as JSON with debounced writes.

## Project Structure

The solution is split into two projects:

| Project | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `McpVectorMemory` | Executable | MCP server with stdio transport — register this in your MCP client |
| `McpVectorMemory.Core` | NuGet Library | Core engine (vector index, graph, clustering, lifecycle, persistence) — use this to embed the memory engine in your own application |

```

```

## NuGet Package

The core engine is available as a NuGet package for use in your own .NET applications.

```bash
dotnet add package McpVectorMemory.Core --version 0.2.0
```

### Library Usage

```csharp
using McpVectorMemory.Core.Models;
using McpVectorMemory.Core.Services;

// Create services
var persistence = new PersistenceManager();
var embedding = new OnnxEmbeddingService();
var index = new CognitiveIndex(persistence);
var graph = new KnowledgeGraph(persistence, index);
var clusters = new ClusterManager(index, persistence);
var lifecycle = new LifecycleEngine(index, persistence);

// Store a memory
var vector = embedding.Embed("The capital of France is Paris");
var entry = new CognitiveEntry("fact-1", vector, "default", "The capital of France is Paris", "facts");
index.Upsert(entry);

// Search by text
var queryVector = embedding.Embed("French capital");
var results = index.Search(queryVector, "default", k: 5);
```

## MCP Tools (36 total)

### Core Memory (3 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `store_memory` | Store a vector embedding with text, category, and optional metadata. Defaults to STM lifecycle state. Warns if near-duplicates are detected. |
| `search_memory` | k-NN search within a namespace with optional lifecycle/category filtering, summary-first mode, physics-based re-ranking, and `explain` mode for full retrieval diagnostics. |
| `delete_memory` | Remove a memory entry by ID. Cascades to remove associated graph edges and cluster memberships. |

### Knowledge Graph (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `link_memories` | Create a directed edge between two entries with a relation type and weight. `cross_reference` auto-creates bidirectional edges. |
| `unlink_memories` | Remove edges between entries, optionally filtered by relation type. |
| `get_neighbors` | Get directly connected entries with edges. Supports direction filtering (outgoing/incoming/both). |
| `traverse_graph` | Multi-hop BFS traversal with configurable depth (max 5), relation filter, minimum weight, and max results. |

Supported relation types: `parent_child`, `cross_reference`, `similar_to`, `contradicts`, `elaborates`, `depends_on`, `custom`.

### Semantic Clustering (5 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_cluster` | Create a named cluster from member entry IDs. Centroid is computed automatically. |
| `update_cluster` | Add/remove members and update the label. Centroid is recomputed. |
| `store_cluster_summary` | Store an LLM-generated summary as a searchable entry linked to the cluster. |
| `get_cluster` | Retrieve full cluster details including members and summary info. |
| `list_clusters` | List all clusters in a namespace with summary status. |

### Lifecycle Management (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `promote_memory` | Manually transition a memory between lifecycle states (`stm`, `ltm`, `archived`). |
| `deep_recall` | Search across ALL lifecycle states. Auto-resurrects high-scoring archived entries above the resurrection threshold. |
| `decay_cycle` | Trigger activation energy recomputation and state transitions for a namespace. |
| `configure_decay` | Set per-namespace decay parameters (decayRate, reinforcementWeight, stmThreshold, archiveThreshold). Used by background service and `decay_cycle` with `useStoredConfig=true`. |

Activation energy formula: `(accessCount x reinforcementWeight) - (hoursSinceLastAccess x decayRate)`

### Admin (2 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_memory` | Retrieve full cognitive context for an entry (lifecycle, edges, clusters). Does not count as an access. |
| `cognitive_stats` | System overview: entry counts by state, cluster count, edge count, and namespace list. |

### Accretion (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_pending_collapses` | List dense LTM clusters detected by the background scanner that are awaiting LLM summarization. |
| `collapse_cluster` | Execute a pending collapse: store a summary entry, archive the source members, and create a cluster. |
| `dismiss_collapse` | Dismiss a detected collapse and exclude its members from future scans. |
| `trigger_accretion_scan` | Manually run a DBSCAN density scan on LTM entries in a namespace. |

`collapse_cluster` reliability behavior:
- If collapse steps complete successfully, the pending collapse is removed and a reversal record is persisted to disk.
- If summary storage or any member archival step fails, the tool returns an error and preserves the pending collapse so the same `collapseId` can be retried.
- Collapse records survive server restarts and can be reversed with `uncollapse_cluster`.

### Intelligence & Safety (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `detect_duplicates` | Find near-duplicate entries in a namespace by pairwise cosine similarity above a configurable threshold. |
| `find_contradictions` | Surface contradictions: entries linked with `contradicts` graph edges, plus high-similarity topic-relevant pairs for review. |
| `uncollapse_cluster` | Reverse a previously executed accretion collapse: restore archived members to pre-collapse state, delete summary, clean up cluster. |
| `list_collapse_history` | List all reversible collapse records for a namespace. |

### Panel of Experts / Debate (3 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `consult_expert_panel` | Consult a panel of experts by running parallel searches across multiple expert namespaces. Stores each perspective in an active-debate namespace and returns integer-aliased results so the LLM can reference nodes without managing UUIDs. Replaces multiple `search_memory` + `store_memory` calls with a single macro-command. |
| `map_debate_graph` | Map logical relationships between debate nodes using integer aliases from `consult_expert_panel`. Translates aliases to UUIDs internally and batch-creates knowledge graph edges. Replaces multiple `link_memories` calls with a single macro-command. |
| `resolve_debate` | Resolve a debate by storing a consensus summary as LTM, linking it to the winning perspective, and batch-archiving all raw debate nodes. Cleans up session state. Replaces manual `store_memory` + `link_memories` + `promote_memory` calls with a single macro-command. |

Debate workflow: `consult_expert_panel` (gather perspectives) → `map_debate_graph` (define relationships) → `resolve_debate` (store consensus). Sessions use integer aliases (1, 2, 3...) so the LLM never handles UUIDs. Sessions auto-expire after 1 hour.

### Benchmarking & Observability (3 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `run_benchmark` | Run an IR quality benchmark. Datasets: `default-v1` (25 seeds, 20 queries), `paraphrase-v1` (25 seeds, 15 queries), `multihop-v1` (25 seeds, 15 queries), `scale-v1` (80 seeds, 30 queries). Computes Recall@K, Precision@K, MRR, nDCG@K, and latency percentiles. |
| `get_metrics` | Get operational metrics: latency percentiles (P50/P95/P99), throughput, and counts for search, store, and other operations. |
| `reset_metrics` | Reset collected operational metrics. Optionally filter by operation type. |

Four benchmark datasets covering programming languages, data structures, ML, databases, networking, systems, security, and DevOps topics. Relevance grades use a 0–3 scale (3 = highly relevant).

### Maintenance (2 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `rebuild_embeddings` | Re-embed all entries in one or all namespaces using the current embedding model. Use after upgrading the embedding model to regenerate vectors from stored text. Entries without text are skipped. Preserves all metadata, lifecycle state, and timestamps. |
| `compression_stats` | Show vector compression statistics for a namespace or all namespaces. Reports FP32 vs Int8 disk savings, quantization coverage, and memory footprint estimates. |

### Expert Routing (2 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `dispatch_task` | Route a query to the most relevant expert namespace via semantic similarity against the meta-index. Returns the expert profile and top memories from that namespace as context, or `needs_expert` status if no qualified expert is found. |
| `create_expert` | Instantiate a new expert namespace and register it in the semantic routing meta-index. The persona description is embedded for future query routing. |

Expert routing workflow: `dispatch_task` (route query) → if miss: `create_expert` (define specialist) → `dispatch_task` (retry). The system maintains a hidden `_system_experts` meta-index that maps queries to specialized namespaces via cosine similarity (default threshold: 0.75). Experts within a 5% score margin of the top match are returned as candidates.

## Architecture

| `HashEmbeddingService` | Deterministic hash-based embeddings for testing/CI (no model dependency) |

### Background Services

| Service | Interval | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `EmbeddingWarmupService` | Startup | Warms up the embedding model on server start so first queries are fast |
| `DecayBackgroundService` | 15 minutes | Runs activation energy decay on all namespaces using stored per-namespace configs |
| `AccretionBackgroundService` | 30 minutes | Scans all namespaces for dense LTM clusters needing summarization |

### Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `CognitiveEntry` | Core memory entry with vector, text, metadata, lifecycle state, and activation energy |
| `QuantizedVector` | Int8 quantized vector with `sbyte[]` data, min/scale for reconstruction, and precomputed self-dot product |
| `FloatArrayBase64Converter` | JSON converter for `float[]` — writes Base64 strings, reads both Base64 and legacy JSON arrays for backwards compatibility |

### Searchable Compression

Vectors use a lifecycle-driven compression pipeline:

- **STM entries**: Full FP32 precision for maximum search accuracy
- **LTM/archived entries**: Auto-quantized to Int8 (asymmetric min/max → [-128, 127]) on state transition
- **Two-stage search**: Namespaces with 30+ entries use Int8 screening (top k×5 candidates) followed by FP32 exact cosine reranking
- **SIMD acceleration**: `Int8DotProduct` uses `System.Numerics.Vector<T>` for portable hardware-accelerated dot products (sbyte→short→int widening pipeline)
- **Base64 persistence**: Vectors are serialized as Base64 strings instead of JSON number arrays, reducing disk usage by ~60%. Legacy JSON arrays are still readable for backwards compatibility.

### Persistence

Data is stored as JSON files in a `data/` directory:
- `{namespace}.json` — entries with Base64-encoded vectors (per namespace)
- `_edges.json` — graph edges (global)
- `_clusters.json` — semantic clusters (global)
- `_collapse_history.json` — reversible collapse records (global)
- `_decay_configs.json` — per-namespace decay configurations (global)

Writes are debounced (500ms default) to avoid excessive disk I/O.

## Usage

### MCP Server

Configure the MCP server in your client (e.g. Claude Desktop, VS Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vector-memory": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "/path/to/mcp-vector-memory/src/McpVectorMemory"]
    }
  }
}
```

## AI Assistant Setup

Each setup below is a single prompt you paste into the respective tool. The AI will read this README, create all config files, and write the custom instructions for you.

### Claude Code Setup

Open Claude Code in your project directory and paste:

```
Set up mcp-vector-memory as my persistent memory system. Do the following:

1. Add the MCP server to my Claude Code config. The server runs via:
   command: dotnet
   args: run --project /path/to/mcp-vector-memory/src/McpVectorMemory

2. Create or update my CLAUDE.md (global at ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md) with vector memory instructions:
   - At conversation start, search vector memory using up to 3 parallel agents:
     Agent 1: search_memory in the project namespace for the current task
     Agent 2: search_memory in "work" and "synthesis" namespaces for cross-project patterns
     Agent 3: search_memory with alternative phrasings/keywords in the project namespace
   - Tool selection: use search_memory for project context, dispatch_task for cross-domain
     questions, consult_expert_panel for multi-perspective analysis, deep_recall for
     archived knowledge, detect_duplicates and find_contradictions for quality checks
   - Store memories after completing tasks, fixing bugs, learning patterns, or receiving
     corrections. Use the project directory name as namespace, kebab-case IDs, include
     domain keywords in text for searchability, and categorize as one of: decision, pattern,
     bug-fix, architecture, preference, lesson, reference
   - Expert routing: use dispatch_task for open-ended questions. If it returns needs_expert,
     call create_expert with a detailed persona, then seed that expert's namespace with
     store_memory
   - Lifecycle: promote STM to LTM when recalled 2+ times, documents a stable pattern,
     captures a recurring bug fix, or records a user correction
   - Link related memories with link_memories using: parent_child, cross_reference,
     similar_to, contradicts, elaborates, depends_on
   - When store_memory warns about duplicates: skip if existing is accurate, upsert same
     ID if outdated, or store and link if both are distinct

Confirm each file you create and show me the final contents.
```

   - Store memories after completing tasks, fixing bugs, learning patterns, or receiving
     corrections. Use project directory name as namespace, kebab-case IDs, write text
     with domain keywords for future searchability, categorize as: decision, pattern,
     bug-fix, architecture, preference, lesson, reference.
   - Expert routing: dispatch_task routes to experts automatically. If needs_expert is
     returned, use create_expert with a detailed persona description, then populate the
     expert namespace with store_memory.
   - Lifecycle: new memories start as STM. Promote to LTM when stable and reused across
     sessions. Link related memories with link_memories using relation types: parent_child,
     cross_reference, similar_to, contradicts, elaborates, depends_on.
   - On duplicate warnings: skip if existing is accurate, upsert if outdated, store and
     link if both are distinct.
