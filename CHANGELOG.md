# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Hierarchical Expert Routing (HMoE)**: 3-level domain tree (root → branch → leaf) with coarse-to-fine semantic routing via cosine similarity. Supports 2-level and 3-level trees with automatic flat fallback. Zero LLM API calls — all routing uses local ONNX embeddings + SIMD dot products.
- **`get_domain_tree` tool**: Inspect the full expert hierarchy showing root domains, branches, and leaf experts.
- **`purge_debates` tool**: Clean up stale `active-debate-*` namespaces older than a configurable age with dry-run support.
- **Namespace cleanup infrastructure**: `DeleteNamespaceAsync` with cascade removal of entries, graph edges, and cluster memberships across JSON and SQLite backends.
- **`create_expert` enhancements**: `level` parameter (`root`, `branch`, `leaf`) and `parentNodeId` for hierarchical tree construction. **Auto-classification**: when `parentNodeId` is omitted for leaf experts, the system automatically scores the persona against all root and branch nodes and places the expert into the best-matching domain (`auto_linked` >= 0.82, `suggested` 0.60–0.82, `unclassified` < 0.60). Placement result is included in the response.
- **`dispatch_task` enhancements**: `hierarchical` parameter for tree-walk routing through domain nodes.
- **`link_to_parent` tool**: Link existing leaf experts to a parent node in the domain tree.
- 49 new tests (27 hierarchical routing + 9 auto-classification + 13 namespace cleanup), bringing total to 534.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **NuGet Build Optimizations**: Embedded debug `.pdb` symbols internally inside the distributed DLL.
- **Embedded Sources**: Added embedded source link mapping so consuming code can cleanly step into `McpEngramMemory.Core` logic directly during debug sessions, offering an unparalleled developer experience.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **McpEngramMemory.Core NuGet Package**: Split the core memory engine into an independent `net8.0` library, extractable via the `McpEngramMemory.Core.csproj` target build. Allows consumers to integrate the vector index natively in-process without relying on MCP RPC endpoints.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Tool profiles**: `MEMORY_TOOL_PROFILE` environment variable to control which tools are exposed (`minimal`, `standard`, `full`). Default: `full` for backward compatibility.
- **Docker support**: Dockerfile for containerized deployment.
- **Examples directory**: Ready-to-use MCP config files for Claude Code, VS Code/Copilot, Gemini CLI, and Codex.
- **Architecture diagram**: Mermaid diagram in README showing system layers.
- **Quickstart section**: 30-second setup guide at the top of README.
- This CHANGELOG.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- Expert routing with `dispatch_task` and `create_expert` tools
- Debate workflow with `consult_expert_panel`, `map_debate_graph`, `resolve_debate`
- Intelligence tools: `detect_duplicates`, `find_contradictions`, `merge_memories`
- Reversible cluster collapse with `uncollapse_cluster` and `list_collapse_history`
- SQLite storage backend (`MEMORY_STORAGE=sqlite`)
- Memory limits via `MEMORY_MAX_NAMESPACE_SIZE` and `MEMORY_MAX_TOTAL_COUNT`
- Per-namespace decay configuration with `configure_decay`
- NuGet package `McpEngramMemory.Core` v0.2.0

### Changed
- Architecture decomposition: CognitiveIndex refactored to thin facade delegating to stateless engines
- Vector serialization switched to Base64 (60% disk reduction), with backward-compatible JSON array reading

## [0.1.0] - Initial Release
